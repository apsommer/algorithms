# Problems vs. Algorithms

The basic algorithms of computer science are explored using Python. Seven problems are solved with careful attention to data structures, time complexity, and space complexity, created as part of the [Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256).
