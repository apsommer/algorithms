# Problems vs. Algorithms

Basic algorithms of computer science are explored using Python. The solution to seven problems are discussed with respect to their data structures and time/space complexity, created as part of the [Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256).
