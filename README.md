# Problems vs. Algorithms

The basic algorithms of computer science are explored using Python. Solution to seven problems are discussed with respect to data structures, time and space complexity, created as part of the [Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256).
