# Dutch National Flag Problem

Given an input array consisting of only 0, 1, and 2, sort the array in a single traversal. You're not allowed to use any sorting function that Python provides.

Note: `O(n)` does not necessarily mean single-traversal. For example, if you traverse the array twice that would still be an `O(n)` solution but it will not count as single traversal.

#### Data Structures

No data structures are required other than the input array and a few primitives for calculations. This is an in-place sort.

#### Time Complexity

Time complexity is `O(n)` by inspection. Each element in the array must be compared once.

#### Space Complexity

Auxiliary complexity is `O(1)` by inspection. This is an in-place sort without any additional data structures.
